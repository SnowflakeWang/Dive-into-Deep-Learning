# Dive-into-Deep-Learning
The project is aimed at documenting my learning process of Dive into Deep Learning.
The project will not be used for commercial purpose.
The book Dive into Deep Learning is a good guidance for novices who are new in Pytorch, TensorFlow or MXNet. Thanks for all authors of the book.
